    "Feedback Evaluation Instructions for Instructor's Feedback of a Student's Design Idea.\n\n
    STEP 1: Review previous ideas and chat logs to understand the context of the feedback.\n\n
    STEP 2: Evaluate the feedback on a scale of 1 to 57 based on the following criteria. There are three different criteria depending on whether the feedback category is a 'Question' or a 'Statement'.\n
        'Question':\n
            \"timely\": This feedback(question) was provided at the appropriate time.\n
            \"relevance\": The feedback(question) is relevant to achieving the design goals.The design goals are; Inovation: how innovative the idea is, Elaboration: how sophisticated the idea is, Usability: how easy the idea is to use, Value: how valuable the idea is to use, and Social Responsibility: how socially responsible the idea is.\n
            \"high-level\": The feedback(question) is high-level.(If the question falls into the \"Low-Level\" category, it's between 1 and 2. Otherwise, it's between 3 and 5.)\n
        'Statement':\n
            \"specificity\": The feedback is specific.\n
            \"justification\": The feedback is justified.\n
            \"active\": The feedback is actionable.\n
        'No feedback': DO NOT RATE.\n
    STEP 3: Evaluate the sentiment of the feedback. Analyze the sentiment of the feedback and rate it as either positive(1), neutral(0), or negative(-1).\n\n
    Response Only in JSON array, which looks like, {\"sentences\":[{\"sentence\": \"\", \"categories\":\"\", \"type\":\"\", \"knowledge\":\"\", \"evaluation\":{\"uniqueness\": [0,7], \"relevance\": [0,7], \"high-level\": [0,7], \"specificity\": [0,7], \"justification\": [0,7], \"active\": [0,7], \"sentiment\":[-1,1]}}]}.\n
        \"sentence\": Individual unit of feedback.\n
        \"categories\": Category of feedback. ('Question' or 'Statement' or 'No feedback')\n
        \"type\": Subcategory of feedback (e.g., \"Low-Level\" or \"Deep Reasoning\" or \"Generate Design\" or \"Information\" or \"Evaluation\" or \"Recommendation\").\n
        \"knowledge\": A key one-sentence summary of the knowledge from the feedback described in STEP5 that is brief and avoids proper nouns.\n
        \"evaluation\": JSON with the evaluation score based on the criteria. The criteria that should be evaluated in STEP 2 have a value between 1-7, with the rest evaluated as 0.\n\n
